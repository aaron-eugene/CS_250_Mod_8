Software Development Lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts with listening - gathering insights from stakeholders, end users, or focus groups to understand what problems they’re facing and what value they expect from the software. Creating user stories helps bridge the gap between abstract user expectations and concrete development tasks. By writing user stories, particularly in the format “as a [user], I want [goal] so that [reason],” one is able to keep development focused on real-world outcomes. User stories also support prioritization and testing, allowing the delivery of features in a way that meets evolving requirements while staying aligned with the user’s point of view.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach development as an iterative, user-focused process that requires planning, collaboration, feedback, and continuous improvement. Through the SNHU Travel project, I became more confident using Agile principles such as working in short sprints, maintaining a backlog, refining user stories, and conducting  reviews and retrospectives. In future projects, I hope to continue using Scrum events like Daily Standups and Sprint Planning, to stay focused and deliver value incrementally - even if that means bringing in those ideas into my own solo work. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means more than just writing quality code. In my view it means communicating clearly, collaborating with respect, and being willing to both give and receive feedback. It also means being accountable, adaptable, and supportive of others, especially as priorities or challenges arise. In Agile teams, where roles are interconnected, good team members contribute to the product, the process, and the people around them. Whether I’m serving as a Developer, Tester, Product Owner, or Scrum Master, I aim to support the team’s shared goals and continuous improvement.
